Smart kitchen automation using NodeMCU and Blynk

Smart kitchen automation refers to the use of technology and connected devices to automate and optimize various tasks and processes in the kitchen. Smart kitchen automation focuses on the benefits and potential of this technology, including increased efficiency, convenience, and safety, as well as reduced energy consumption and waste. Key features of smart kitchen automation include voice-activated controls, sensors.

DHT11 Humidity Temperature Sensor, MQ-135 Gas Sensor, Passive IR sensor is used to monitor the Indoor Air Quality Parameters. 
5V buzzer can work as an alarming system.

Using a 4 channel relay, an automatic exhaust Fan is connected which activates automatically when the gas level exceeds the threshold value. The remaining 3 relays can be connected to kitchen appliances like Mixer, Refrigerator, Oven, Water Heater, Induction stove, etc. 

A 0.96″ I2C OLED is used to display room temperature, humidity, and gas value . 

We will use a NodeMCU ESP8266 Board. The ESP8266 chip connects to the WiFi Network and establishes a connection with Blynk Application
